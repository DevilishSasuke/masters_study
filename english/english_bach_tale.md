I. Research Topic

- The topic of my research is **developing a model and creating a prototype application for recognizing vehicle license plates from video**.

- The study focuses on **how to make a system that can find and read license plates automatically in real time using computer vision**.

II. Relevance of the Topic

- The problem of **automatic license plate recognition** is very important today in **transport, parking, and security systems**

- Many existing systems are **too expensive or need special equipment**, which makes them difficult to use everywhere.

- That is why it is important to **create a cheaper and more flexible solution** that can work in different real situations.

- Even though computer vision has improved a lot, **many systems still have problems with speed or accuracy**.

- Today, there is a growing interest in smart road and video monitoring systems*, so this topic is very relevant.

III. Research Subject

- The subject of my research is **developing and testing a neural network model for recognizing license plates from real video**.

- The main problem I study is **how to make the system fast and accurate at the same time**

IV. Aim of the Research

1. The main aim of my work is **to build a working prototype that can detect and recognize license plates in real time**.

2. I also wanted to **check if combining YOLO for detection and OCR for text recognition gives good results**.

3. I tried to **find the best balance between accuracy and speed** when processing video frames.

V. Research Tasks

- The main tasks of my research were:
  
  - To **study existing technologies and systems** for plate recognition.
  
  - To **choose the best tools** for implementation.
  
  - To **train and test models** for object detection and text recognition.
  
  - To **create and test the final prototype** of the application.

- I focused on **finding the best way to combine models and improve performance**.

VI. Significance of the Research

- The practical value of my research is that **the created prototype can be used for video surveillance, parking systems, and traffic monitoring**.

- The system is simple to use and does not need expensive or special equipment, which makes it more available for many organizations.

- The main question of my study was **how to make the system both fast and accurate at the same time**.

VII. Research Methods

- In my work, I used **practical experiments and model testing**.

- I compared different object detection models and OCR tools to find the best combination.

- The main method I used was **computer vision with neural networks**, including the **YOLO model for detection** and **PaddleOCR for text recognition**.

- I also used Python programming and libraries such as **OpenCV and PyTorch** to process images and train the model.

VIII. Conclusions

- As a result of my research, **I created and tested a working prototype of a license plate recognition system**.

- The system detects and recognizes vehicle numbers in real time with **high accuracy, around 95%**, and the average frame processing time is about **20 milliseconds**.

- The chosen models — **YOLOv8s for object detection** and **PaddleOCR for text recognition** — showed the best balance between speed and accuracy.

- These results confirm that **modern deep learning technologies can be used to build effective recognition systems** even with limited resources.

IX. Recommendations for Future Research

- In the future, it is possible to **improve the model to work better in difficult conditions**, such as bad lighting, rain, or motion blur.

- Another direction for development is **to make a full desktop or web application with a graphical interface**.

- It is also important to **train the system on more diverse datasets** to recognize numbers from different countries and regions.
